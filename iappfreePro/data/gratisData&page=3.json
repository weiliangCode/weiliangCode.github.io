            "releaseNotes": "We thought updating our design to use the new iOS7 look, but guess what?!  We already had a 'flat design', so we didn't have to make a lot of changes, just couple pieces here and there.\nSo today you will see that: \n. We made it FREE for a limited time\n. We improve performance\n. Fixed some issues with the game\n. We've added new backgrounds\n. More word packs available\n. New iOS7 icon\n. SPANISH translation. Si señor!\n\nTell us what you think and don't forget to rate!",
